- 👋 Hi, I’m Tinyiko Evans Novela...
- 👀 I’m interested in business systems that enable users to work with ease and achieve objectives with limited constrains. I usually perform day to day developer tasks like writing new code, debugging, and maintaining existing systems, this includes and not limited to providing support, improving current process and applications and bridging the gap between business and IT
- 🌱 I’m currently learning reactjs and angular...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any dotnet open source platforms...
- 📫 I can be reached at info@tinyikoevans.co.za ...
